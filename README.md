# Puffer

Wireless Ergo Split Mechanical Keyboard.
Based on the [temper keyboard](https://github.com/raeedcho/temper), the Puffer has been upgraded for more comfortable use by those with larger hands.

Only supports Kailh Choc for now.

## Updates

- Increase spacing between keys, from choc spacing (18x17mm) to 19x18mm
- Optional direct soldering of switches or hotswap pads
- Added tenting puck support


## Features

- Reversible PCB

## Other changes

- Only supports SMD Diodes now


## TODO

- List features
- Make case and bottom plate (not compatible with temper/chocofi since board is bigger)
